# axon-playground

The idea behind this repo is to provide multiple projects based on
[axon-quick-start](https://github.com/AxonIQ/axon-quick-start)
where we demonstrate the same project but with different frameworks/technologies
and how easy it is to have AxonFramework up and running.

Feel free to reach me out if you have ideas for other frameworks and technologies.
